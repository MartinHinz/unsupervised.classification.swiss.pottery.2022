[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/MartinHinz/unsupervised.classification.swiss.pottery.2022/master?urlpath=rstudio)

This repository contains the data and code for our paper:

> Hinz, M., Heitz, C., (2022). _`r Title`_. Open Archaeology 8(1) <https://doi.org/10.1515/opar-2022-0274>

## Pre-Release

This prerelease contains not the actual dataset used in the analysis of that paper, but a dummy dataset based on iberian Bell Beakers.

**Do not use this dummy data for real research analysis!!!**

### How to cite

Please cite this compendium as:

> Hinz, M., Heitz, C., (`r format(Sys.Date(), "%Y")`). _Compendium of R code and data for `r Title`_. Accessed `r format(Sys.Date(), "%d %b %Y")`. Online at <https://doi.org/xxx/xxx>

## Contents

The **analysis** directory contains:

  - [:file\_folder: code](/analysis/code): The code to run the analysis. You can run ´run_all_scripts.R´ to do the full analysis based on the input data. You can also run the individual scripts sequentially to see the inbetween results. Functions used in the analysis are defined in the ´00_helper_functions´ folder.
  - [:file\_folder: data](/analysis/data): Data used in the analysis. For this pre-release, this folder contains **Dummy data!!!**

## How to run in your browser or download and run locally

This research compendium has been developed using the statistical programming
language R. To work with the compendium, you will need
installed on your computer the [R software](https://cloud.r-project.org/)
itself and optionally [RStudio Desktop](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).

The simplest way to explore the text, code and data is to click on
[binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/MartinHinz/unsupervised.classification.swiss.pottery.2022/master?urlpath=rstudio)
to open an instance of RStudio in your browser, which will have the
compendium files ready to work with. Binder uses rocker-project.org
Docker images to ensure a consistent and reproducible computational
environment. These Docker images can also be used locally.

You can download the compendium as a zip from from this URL:
[master.zip](https://codeload.github.com/MartinHinz/unsupervised.classification.swiss.pottery.2022/zip/refs/heads/master). After unzipping:
- open the `.Rproj` file in RStudio
- run `devtools::install()` to ensure you have the packages this analysis depends on (also listed in the
[DESCRIPTION](/DESCRIPTION) file).
- finally, open `analysis/code/run_all_scripts.R`
